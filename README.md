A color changing live wallpaper which uses **phone camera to analyze and extract colors**. You can set Chameleon as the default wallpaper and then point and shoot subjects.
Chameleon will extract colors and update the wallpaper automatically.

**Use with KWLP:**

Chameleon shares the colors extracted with KLWP though its plugin system. Hence it's possible to create your own wallpapers with colors from Chameleon. Never use the same colors anymore.
